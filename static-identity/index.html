        <p>This game is an adaption of "<a href="http://www.tuesdayknightgames.com/tworoomsandaboom/">Two Rooms and a Boom</a>."</p>
        <p>
            Two Rooms and a Boom is a social deduction, hidden role game. There are two teams, the <span class="team-bomber">Red Team</span>
            and the <span class="team-president">Blue Team</span>. The <span class="team-president">Blue Team</span> has a
            <span class="team-president"><em>President</em></span>.
            The <span class="team-bomber">Red Team</span> has a <span class="team-bomber"><em>Bomber</em></span>.
            Players are equally distributed between two rooms (separate playing areas). The game consists of 5 timed rounds.
            At the end of each round, some players will be traded into opposing rooms.
            If the <span class="team-bomber">Red Team</span>’s <span class="team-bomber"><em>Bomber</em></span> is in
            the same room as the <span class="team-president">Blue Team</span>'s <span class="team-president"><em>President</em></span> at the end of the game,
            then the <span class="team-bomber">Red Team</span> wins.
            Otherwise the <span class="team-president">Blue Team</span> wins.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this adaptation, label each player as a random unique number from 1 to the amount of players.
            Insert all the values in to and your role should display on your device.
        </p>

        <p>
            Randomly separate the players into two rooms. The “rooms” can be
            separated by a wall, door, or simply two open areas at a distance from each other.
            It is not important if players can see one another, but players in the separate rooms
            shouldn't be able to hear one another.
        </p>

        <p>
            Start the timer at the specified time (see "Time/Leadership).
        </p>

        <p>
            The first player that is nominated by another player to be the leader becomes
            leader. That player should take the leader card as a visual identifier for others
            players to see. It is important that players in a room can easily identify their room
            leader. If other players are not happy with this leader, they may attempt to change
            leaders.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nominate a leader by pointing at them and if a majority agree then change leaders. A leader can willingly give up their
            leadership to anyone they so choose. A leader can change at anytime.
        </p>

        <p>
            Leaders have the final say in who the hostages will be. Make sure you trust your leaders.
        </p>

        <p>
            *Note: Leaders cannot be hostages themselves
