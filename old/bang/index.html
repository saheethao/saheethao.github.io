        <h2>Dice</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                1 - Close shot:  Choose the player next to you on your left or right (1 position away).
                That player loses one life point.
            </li>
            <li>
                2 - Long shot:  Choose the player 2 positions away on your left or right. That player loses one life point.
            </li>
            <li>
                3 - Arrow: You must resolve this die immediately when rolled.
                Take one arrow token (one per arrow rolled) and keep it in front of you.
                You may roll this die again if you have re-rolls left. If you take the last arrow, each player loses
                one life point for each arrow they have. Then all players discard their arrows. Resume your turn.
            </li>
            <li>
                4 - Dynamite: This die cannot be re-rolled. If you roll three or more Dynamites, your turn ends immediately
                and you lose one life point. But, all your other dice results are still resolved as normal.
            </li>
            <li>
                5 -  Beer: Choose ANY player. That player gains one life point. A player can never gain more life points
                than the number they had at the beginning of the game.
            </li>
            <li>
                6 - Gatling: If you roll three or more Gatlings you activate the Gatling Gun.
                Each of the other players loses one life point. Also, you discard all of your arrows.
            </li>
        </ul>
